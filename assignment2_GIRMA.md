The database we are using for this assignment on networks belongs to the Supreme Court and it has documentation of all the cases. I chose the Supreme Court cases regarding desegregation in schools along with affirmative action and employment discrimination. The focus of these cases tend to overlap and I was interested in seeing if employment discrimination was impacted by affirmative action. This can be illustrated through networks because the characteristics of R studio allow us to explore various aspects of the networks. For example, the centrality looks at the most important nodes and vertices of the network. The nodes in this situation are the Supreme Court cases and the vertices are the connections between them. R studio also allows us to explore the clusters and gatekeepers of the network. The clusters are communities of data that have cited one another, this helps to look for how one case can impact the other. The gatekeeper connects nodes from different communities which help understand how what may seem like unrelated topics connect with the each other. R studio also allows the data to be coordinated by year, issue, and vote. 

When looking at the centrality the most important nodes were cases based on education and affirmative action.  Brown v Board of education is one that was very central to this network and that did not surprise me because I expected it to be very important. Another important case was City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. This case stated that “ minority set-aside program, which gave preference to minority business enterprises” was unconstitutional. This piqued my interest because it shows how affirmative action affected more than just college admissions. 

The two main clusters present highlight two different types of cases. There is one community of industrial and companies versus the states or other organizations. The other community is focused on school board cases. These cases intersect with a couple of cases which are also present as gatekeeper connections. 

R studio highlighted four cases as the gatekeepers between the clusters or communities. The four main cases were Griggs v. Duke Power Co., Teamsters v. the United States,  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, Washington v. Davis.  Looking closer at these cases they focused directly on discrimination and actually learned more towards discrimination in the workplace versus education. That did not surprise me because it is understandable that these cases could link to education or school segregation. Also when looking at the network that focused on issues it was very visible that affirmative action actually was in a way a link between desegregation of schools and employment discrimination. This I found very interesting and it highlighted that by looking at the different tools, new findings are present. 

I found the centrality, clusters and gatekeeper tool most useful when analyzing my data set. One of the downsides of networks is that they flatten time and often it is hard to distinguish it. This dataset tackles that issue by dating the Supreme Court cases. This data specifically was really good at showing the dates visibly to see the clear.
