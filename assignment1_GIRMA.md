This specific set of data from Jstor is designed to showcase the various aspects of Afro-Latino culture. I chose this data specifically because I am interested in the interconnection of these two cultures. I especially was interested in the focus of the Haitian and Dominican connections because I know that in certain texts Domains do not address their Africanism, through prior knowledge I also recognize the racial tension between the two nations that share an island. I chose the Afro-Latino Review, I chose this data specifically because it addresses both African and Latino culture along with the history that ties into that. The Afro-Latino Review does also focus on the languages and their connection, which from a linguistics and rhetorics perspective in interesting because of how cultural shifts during a period of time affected the collective language of multiple nations. As I was deciding the topic models, I realized that when the topic amount got larger I realized the majority of the categories formed categories of stop words. When I tried to decrease the number any number below 15 would incorporate themes within each other. 

At first glance the data contains many prepositional and possessive phases that take away from the data. As I analyzed the data, in the beginning, I observed that most phrases had Afro-Latino references, but also each had a certain theme. Some categories addressed poetry and literature while others highlighted the history of ethnicities and racial structures. A pattern that I noticed is that there are more clusters closely associated with the topic of literature. I noticed this trend because of another topic that was made in reference to poetry, just showcasing that literature is a large aspect of this study. Another trend that I noticed is the differentiation between propositional and possessive phrase, the clusters of stop phrases even begin to differ at a certain point which I found particularly interesting. These topics tell us that the most specific parts of Afro-Latino cultures are the literature, locations, poetry, race, and diversity.

Some the of downfalls of topic modeling is as highlighted in one of the readings we did in class, a computer does not read the way we read. The lack of differentiation between certain words makes some of these word associations not as strong. Also adding to the fact that my specific dataset incorporated a different language the lack of differentiation is also possible in the afro-latino languages. If I were to continue further with this I would create a stop list with certain prepositional and possessive phrases. I want to specify the ones taken away because I noticed some possessive phrases are closely clustered with nations and languages to emphasize ownership and not just as a filler word but it has meaning. Overall I feel that topic modeling is a great tool to begin research and it can be used as a starting place to further research endeavors. I would further this research by creating a web or a chart that separates the terms and connections by nation or territory and I would track that over a period of time. This would create for room to develop specific questions that address social-cultural topics and it can be applied to any nation on a broader context.
