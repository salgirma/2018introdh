When I began collecting data for this project I was very excited to see how my perception of place would be defined on campus. Looking back and reflecting on the data I collected I realized that the specific week was very different from my regular schedule. I felt that this map aligned more with how my week would have looked during a time of a big event. Looking at the data points I realized that the majority of my week was spent in meeting rooms planing out collaboration events and drafting a project proposal. 

Building the online map itself was not as difficult to me as building the story map that went along with it. The most difficult aspect of the map itself is the ambiguity that occurs when some of the points are plotted. Certain points had to be selected to show up as a color other than grey. When deciding what kind of topography I wanted my map to represent I focused on showcasing the physical buildings along with having a background that allowed the points to be visible instead of blending in. 

In the Crampton reading of GIS and space, cartography and maps were seen as having political biases that may be used to appeal to various different points (Crampton, IntroCh1, 2010). This can be applied as to how the university uses many physical features of campus to appeal to the public because of the scenery and beauty but also neglects to mention the discomfort this campus is to people who are disabled. The amount of hills and hill-like structures that this campus is built on makes it extremely difficult to navigate if one is not an able-bodied person. Features like this most definitely have the ability to affect one's perception of this space as a place that serves as a home away from home.  My personal opinions of the University of Richmond as a place, my home away from home, definitely has a political draw in terms of the history of this University.  This ties into directly to the reason why I spent so much time in Tyler Haynes Commons, in an effort to make the University of Richmond a place and not just a space for students of color, I along with other student organizations came together to draft a proposal for a multicultural space on campus. 

It did not occur to me that I was avidly doing work to address issues or setbacks of having a space that is often difficult to place. The conversions done in the creation of this proposal can be seen as an example of a solution that can be done to address the lack of adaptability one may face at an institution like the University of Richmond. 

A limit of the spatial mapping method we used for this project is the lack of comparison of data for other weeks. I feel that this project would have been a better representation of how a normal week at the University of Richmond is had it been a less complex and event-packed week. Possible doing this assignment over the course of two weeks or two separate weeks would provide more data that can, in turn, be an accurate reflection of how Richmond is as a space for me beyond a place.
